Hi! My name is Josh Rees-Jones. Here's a little bit about me.

This is me.

I have a twin brother, Mitch.

I used to live on a boat when I was young.

My team and I made [poker-playing robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLgWSh6EKPQ) at IBM Watson last summer.

Also:

- I am motivated to an extreme.
- I have a growth mindset. I'm constantly trying to be more efficient, effective, and impactful. I'm currently obsessed with the writing of [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/) and [Alex Vermeer](https://alexvermeer.com/).
- I enjoy playing classical and pop piano. I'm learning [Fantasie Impromptu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvm2ZsRv3C8) by Chopin and [Trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcASPx3-HuI) by Coldplay.
- I can perform [this Rowan Atkinson skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umRRCkspaQU) on command.
- I'm studying abroad at Lund University in Sweden in the fall.
- I play didgeridoo.

That's me! Check out my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume/) or [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/).
