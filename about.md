Hi! My name is Josh Rees-Jones. Here's a little bit about me.

This is me.

I have a twin brother, Mitch.

I used to live on a boat when I was young.

My team and I worked made [poker-playing robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLgWSh6EKPQ) at IBM Watson last summer.

I like to go backpacking.

I'm a competitive runner and coach for the [club team](https://clubs.ncsu.edu/crosscountry/) at NC State. My mile PR is 4:29 (though I finished the last 800m of that race in 2:08).

Also:

- I am motivated to an extreme.
- I have a growth mindset. I'm constantly trying to be more efficient, effective, and impactful. [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/) and [Alex Vermeer](https://alexvermeer.com/) are very inspirational.
- I enjoy playing classical and pop piano. I'm learning [Fantasie Impromptu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvm2ZsRv3C8) by Chopin and [Trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcASPx3-HuI) by Coldplay.
- I can do [this Rowan Atkinson skit]() really well (at least I think so). I can do [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGFz9gt0-Fc) fairly well also too.
- I'm applying to study abroad at Lund University in the fall.
- I play didgeridoo.

That's me! Check out my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume/) or [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/).
